    "### Why automate web browsing?\n",
    "There are two main purposes to automate web browsing,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test website functionality, which is usually implemented by web developer automating testing to reduce the cost and time, while also providing a means of round the clock testing. It also makes cross-browser proofing easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Botting Processes, a piece of software that executes commands or perform routine tasks without the user intervention. This can be applied to any repetitive task online, such as order take-out everyday from a website, filling out forms, logging in, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Selenium** is a Python package that provides a simple API to write functional/acceptance tests using Selenium WebDriver.  Through Selenium Python API people can access all functionalities of Selenium Web Driver in an intuitive way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Resource: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Selenium interfaces with the internet by using a web driver, which is a browser that Selenium can use to automate web processes. The two we recommend using are **Chrome Driver**, which runs Google Chrome or **Gecko Driver**, which runs Firefox. You can select whichever browser you feel more comfortable with, and use a package installer to download either one of the drivers. FYI, we use Chrome Driver in the demonstration.\n",

    "Most actions performed with Selenium can be accomplished with a single function. For a more challenging web driver action, we explore to use Selenium for drag and drop action. As we know, this action consists of three basic steps. First, an object or text must be **selected**. Then it must be **drag** to the desired position. And finally **dropped** into a place. To accomplish this task, we need a **source element** that we want to drag and a **destination element** we want to drop to. \n",

    "## Part III - Selenium Implicit Wait Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with scraping modern day websites is many of them use asynchronous techniques, like Ajax, to load their webpages. This method allows web servers to update parts of their webpage without reloading the entire thing, so that they are able to create fast loading and dynamic webpages. However, this becomes a problem when Selenium web driver tries to locate a web element before it's loaded. This causes an exception with our script and our program not working. This transitions us into why we need **wait functions**. **Wait function** adds crucial time intervals in between actions performed, thus allowing the web driver to wait until an element is loaded before it interacts with it. Selenium offers two types of wait, **explicit** and **implicit**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explicit wait**: When paired with a condition, the program wait until that condition is satisfied before executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implicit wait**: Try to pull the DOM for a certain amount of time until the element is available.\n",

    "## Implicit Wait Function\n",

    "To practice implementing wait functions, we are going to explore [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/), which uses Ajas to loads its elements.
