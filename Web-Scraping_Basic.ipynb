    "# Web Scraping Basic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web scraping** is a popular way to gather data online because it offers an inexpensive alternative to the traditional means of extracting information. With the bountiful amounts of data online it is essential to learn how to complie your own data cheaply and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are three basic steps of web scraping:\n",
    "1. Sending a get query to the website\n",
    "2. Website returns an HTML based document containing all of the website's information.\n",
    "3. Parsing the HTML document making it more navigable and extracting the data we actually want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries:\n",
    "1. **Beautiful Soup**: Creates a parsed and navigable html document\n",
    "2. **lxml**: Uses for processing the HTML\n",
    "3. **requests**: Creates the get query to the website\n",
